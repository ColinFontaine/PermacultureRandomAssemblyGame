# PermacultureRandomAssemblyGame
A simple word game that situates permaculture elements in relation to one another for design brainstorming

This is a fun word game that will print random sentences with the format (element + preposition + element).
It can be used to brainstorm different placements and relations of things on site.

If you want to add any new elements feel free, the more there are the more robust the program will become.
